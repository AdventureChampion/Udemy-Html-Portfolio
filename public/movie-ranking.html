<h1>The Champions Chosen Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3><stong><em>Jurassic Park</em></stong></h3>
<p>Captured my imagination as a child and has never let go. <b><em>Also, Jeff Goldblum</em></b></p>

<h3><em>When Harry Met Sally</em></h3>
<p>A feel good classic rom com that never gets old</p>

<h3><em>The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo</em></h3>
<p>Just a fantastic slow burn mystery movie that really kept me hooked.</p>
